We're talking away (choose these times arbitrarily, please change them to better match the song)

I don't know what I'm to say
6
I'll say it anyway
6
Today is another day to find you
6
Shyin' away
6
Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay
6
Take on me
6
(Take on me)
6
Take me on
6
(Take on me)
6
I'll be gone
6
In a day or two
6
So needless to say
6
I'm odds and ends
6
But I'll be stumblin' away
6
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
6
Say after me
6
It's no better to be safe than sorry
5
Take on me
6
(Take on me)
6
Take me on
6
(Take on me)
6
I'll be gone
6
In a day or two
6
All the things that you say, yeah
6
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
6
You're all the things I've got to remember
6
You're shyin' away
6
I'll be comin' for you anyway
6
Take on me
6
(Take on me)
6
Take me on
6
(Take on me)
6
I'll be gone
6
In a day
6
(Take on me)
6
(Take on me)
6
(Take me on)
6
(Take on me)
6
I'll be gone
6
(Take on me)
6
In a day
6
(Take me on)
6
(Take on me)
6
(Take on me)
6
(Take on me)
6
(Take me on)
6
(Take on me)
