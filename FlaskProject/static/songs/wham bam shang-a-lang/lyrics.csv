I walked across an empty land
1
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
3
I felt the earth beneath my feet
3
Sat by the river and it made me complete
3
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
3
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
3
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
3
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
3
I came across a fallen tree
3
I felt the branches of it looking at me
3
Is this the place we used to love?
3
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
3
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
3
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
3
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
3
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
3
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
4
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
3
This could be the end of everything
4
So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
3
Somewhere only we know
4
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
3
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
4
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
3
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
4
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
3
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
4
This could be the end of everything
3
So, why don't we go?
4
So, why don't we go?
3
Ooh, oh-oh
4
Ah, oh
3
This could be the end of everything
4
So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
3
Somewhere only we know
4
Somewhere only we know
