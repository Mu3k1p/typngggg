I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
3
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind
2
And when they ask me how I'm doing
5
I say	 "I'm just fine"
5
And when they ask me how I'm doing
5
I say	 "I'm just fine"
3
But the fact is
3
I can never get off of my mattress
6
And all that they can ask is
7
Why are you so sad, kid? (Why are you so sad	 kid?)
8
That's what the mask is
7
That's what the point of the mask is
9
So you can see I'm tryin'
6
You won't see me cryin'
6
I'll just keep on smilin'	 I'm good (yeah	 I'm good)
8
And it just keeps on pilin'
5
It's so terrifying
3
But I keep on smilin'	 I'm good (yeah	 I'm good)
3
I've been carin' too much for so long
6
Been comparin' myself for so long
6
Been wearin' a smile for so long	 it's real
7
So long	 it's real	 so long	 it's real
7
Always bein' judged by a bunch of strange faces
8
Scared to go outside	 haven't seen the light in ages
9
But I've been places
4
So I'm okay-ish	 so I'm okay-ish
3
Yeah	 I'm okay	 bitch
4
But the fact is
4
I need help	 I'm failin' all my classes
7
They think that I need glasses
6
I just really wish that I could pass this (wish that I could pass this)

That's what the mask is

That's what the point of the mask is
